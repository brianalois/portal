## Structure
1. components  - Views
2. guards      - Protect Routes/Pages (middleware for frontend)
3. helpers	   - Reusable Functionality in different components or models
4. interfaces  - When there is data with same data structure
5. models	   - When there are multiple objects/instances with same data structure
6. services    - Reusable Functionality in different only components (do not know if this is necessary if using helpers)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
